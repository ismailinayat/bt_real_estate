Before jumping into code it is always a good idea to map out our database schema. Because we need to decide which fields we need to put in our models. Usually the way to figure this out is by looking
at the requirement i-e what needs to be displayed in our web application. We can list all the fields in a text file or we can use some kind of advance software for this which will help us in making of
boxes etc. In this project we will keep it simple and use text file.

MODEL/DB FIELDS:
We need 3 database schemas:

### LISTING:
            It will contain all the fields that we want to display for each listing page.
